# Battleship Game

## Description
This project is a classic Battleship game implemented in C++. This version of the game is designed to be played on the command line and offers both a standard and a customizable game mode.

## Features

- **Customizable Grid Size**: Players can set the size of the game board.
- **Variable Number of Ships**: Players can decide how many ships of each type they want to place.
- **Random Ship Placement**: Ships are placed randomly on the board at the start of the game.
- **Gameplay Statistics**: Post-game, the game provides statistics such as the number of shots fired and the optimal number of shots. It also evaluates the user's performance, offering feedback based on how closely their shot count approached the minimum shots needed.
- **Debugging Views**: A view mode to see where all ships are located (for testing purposes).
